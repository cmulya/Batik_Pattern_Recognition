# Batik_Pattern_Recognition

Batik, an intricate textile art form originating from Indonesia, holds significant cultural and historical importance. For centuries, this traditional craft has served as a medium for storytelling, conveying narratives, and preserving cultural heritage. However, in the face of modernization and globalization, there is a growing concern that younger generations are becoming less familiar with this rich cultural legacy. Leveraging technology to promote cultural understanding and preservation has become imperative in safeguarding the essence of batik. 

In this project, we embark on a journey to harness the power of deep learning methodologies to address the challenge of preserving and promoting batik appreciation. Our approach centers around the utilization of the EfficientNetV2 architecture, a state-of-the-art deep learning model renowned for its efficiency, scalability, and performance. By leveraging EfficientNetV2, we aim to develop a robust system capable of automatic batik recognition, facilitating easy identification and understanding of intricate batik patterns.
